When merging a feature branch into the main branch in Git, we may encounter merge conflicts if changes in both branches affect the same lines of code.  
Here's how to resolve these conflicts step-by-step:

### Step 1: Attempt to Merge the Feature Branch

1. **Switch to the Main Branch**: Make sure we are on the main branch.  
   Command - `git checkout main`

2. **Merge the Feature Branch**: Attempt to merge the feature branch into the main branch.  
   Command - `git merge feature/our-feature-name`

3. **Identify Conflicts**: If there are conflicts, Git will display a message indicating which files have conflicts. The affected files will be marked as "unmerged."

### Step 2: Open the Conflicted Files

1. **Locate Conflicted Files**: Use `git status` to see a list of files with merge conflicts.  
   Command - `git status`

2. **Open Each Conflicted File**: Open each file in your text editor or IDE. Conflicts will be marked with conflict markers.

### Step 3: Resolve the Conflicts

1. **Decide How to Resolve**: For each conflict, decide how to resolve it. We can choose one version, combine both, or rewrite the code. Remove the conflict markers after making your changes.

2. **Edit the Code**: Modify the code as necessary to create a single, coherent version.

### Step 4: Mark the Conflicts as Resolved

1. **Add the Resolved Files**: After resolving conflicts in all files, stage the changes.  
   Command - `git add <file1> <file2> ...`

2. **Commit the Merge**: Once all conflicts are resolved and staged, commit the merge.  
   Command - `git commit -m "Resolved merge conflicts"`

### Step 5: Complete the Merge

1. **Check the Log**: Verify that the merge was successful and that your commit history is correct.  
   Command - `git log`

2. **Push Changes (if necessary)**: If we are working with a remote repository, push the changes to the main branch.  
   Command - `git push origin main`

Resolving merge conflicts is a common task in collaborative development. By following these steps, we can efficiently resolve conflicts and ensure that the main branch remains stable while integrating changes from feature branches.
