### CI/CD Integration: Setting Up a Basic CI/CD Pipeline Using GitHub Actions for a Node.js Application

Continuous Integration (CI) and Continuous Deployment (CD) are essential practices in modern software development, allowing teams to automatically test and deploy applications. 
Steps to set up a basic CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions for a Node.js application.

#### Step 1: Create a Node.js Application
We have to ensure that a Node.js application is set up in a GitHub repository. Our application should include:

- A package.json file for managing dependencies and scripts.
- A test script defined in the package.json.


#### Step 2: Create a GitHub Actions Workflow
1. In your GitHub repository, navigate to the "Actions" tab.
2. Click on "New workflow."
3. Choose "Set up a workflow yourself" to create a custom workflow.

#### Step 3: Define Your Workflow Configuration
Then we create a file named `.github/workflows/ci-cd.yml` in our repository and define the workflow:

```yaml
name: CI/CD Pipeline

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main  
  pull_request:
    branches:
      - main  

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v2

      - name: Set up Node.js
        uses: actions/setup-node@v2
        with:
          node-version: '16'  

      - name: Install dependencies
        run: npm install

      - name: Run tests
        run: npm test

      - name: Deploy
        if: github.ref == 'refs/heads/main'
        run: |
          # Add your deployment commands here
```

#### Step 4: Final Step
Create a MR or merge a branch to the main branch that will trigger our ci/cd workflow and you can monitor 
the progress of each step, view logs, and diagnose any issues.
