**GitFlow** is a branching strategy that organizes software development into manageable sections, allowing multiple developers to work simultaneously while keeping the codebase stable.

### Key Branches:

1. **Main branch**: Contains stable, production-ready code.
2. **Develop branch**: Integrates completed features before merging into main.
3. **Feature Branches**: Created for individual features, merging back into develop when complete.
4. **Release Branches**: Used for final adjustments before merging into main.
5. **Hotfix Branches**: Created from main to quickly address critical issues.

### Implementation for a New Feature:

1. **Create a Feature Branch**:  
   When starting a new feature, create a new branch from the develop branch. This keeps the feature isolated until it’s ready to be merged.

2. **Develop the Feature**:  
   Make changes, add files, and commit your changes to the feature branch.

3. **Merge Back to Develop**:  
   Once the feature is complete and tested, switch back to the develop branch and merge the feature branch into it.

4. **Delete the Feature Branch**:  
   After merging, it’s a good practice to delete the feature branch to keep the repository clean.

5. **Prepare for Release**:  
   When the develop branch has enough features for a release, create a release branch for final adjustments and testing.

6. **Merge Release into Main**:  
   Once everything is finalized, merge the release branch into the main branch and tag the release.

7. **Hotfixes**:  
   If any critical issues arise after the release, create a hotfix branch from main, resolve the issue, and merge back into both main and develop.

This structured approach helps maintain a clean and manageable codebase, allowing teams to collaborate efficiently on new features and fixes.
